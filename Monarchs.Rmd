## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Packages

library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

# read Data

Monarker <- read.csv2("data/Den danske kongerække - færdig.csv")

# Making visualization

Monarker %>% 
  select(Monarchs, Start_Reign, End_Reign) %>% 
  mutate(Reign = End_Reign - Start_Reign) %>% 
  mutate(Monarchs = reorder (Monarchs, Reign)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Reign, y = Monarchs, fill = Reign))+
  geom_col()+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title = "Duration of Reign", x = "Reign in Years", y = "Monarch")

# I have the geom_col function for the geometry, for the reason that I think it best shows the reign of the Monarcks
